        "reasoning": "Sure, let's work through this step by step!\n\n1. The bill was divided evenly among the three people: Sally, Sam, and Alyssa.\n2. Each person paid $45, so we can write:\n\nSally paid: $45\nSam paid: $45\nAlyssa paid: $45\n\n3. Since the bill was divided evenly, the total amount that each person paid is equal to the total amount of the bill. So, we can set up an equation:\n\nTotal Bill = Sally's Payment + Sam's Payment + Alyssa's Payment\n\n4. We know that each person paid $45, so we can substitute that into the equation:\n\nTotal Bill = $45 + $45 + $45\n\n5. Now we can simplify the equation:\n\nTotal Bill = $45 x 3\n\n6. Evaluate the expression:\n\nTotal Bill = $45 x 3\nTotal Bill = $135\n\nTherefore, the total of the bill was $135.",

But we also know that Sam had $16 left after buying them, so we can set up an equation:\n\n$79 - $16 = $9 (since $16 is the amount of money Sam had left)\n\nNow we need to solve for the variable ($9 in this case).

After spending the morning sowing seeds, she now has 6 buckets left.\n\nSo, we know that the farmer sowed some amount of seeds, and now she has 6 buckets less than she started with. We can set up an equation to represent this situation:\n\nLet X be the number of buckets of seeds the farmer sowed.\n\nSince she started with 8.75 buckets, we know that:\n\n8.75 - X = 6 (since she now has 6 buckets left)\n\nNow we need to solve for X, the number of buckets of seeds the farmer sowed. To do this, we can subtract 8.75 from both sides of the equation:\n\nX = 8.75 - 6\n\nX = 2.75\n\nSo, the farmer sowed 2.75 buckets of seeds in the morning.",

        "reasoning": "Sure, let's break it down step by step!\n\n1. First, we know that the old lamp is 1 foot tall, so we can start by converting both lamps to the same unit of measurement, like inches.\n\n1 foot = 12 inches\n\nSo, the old lamp is:\n\n1 foot x 12 inches/foot = 12 inches tall\n\n2. Now, we know that the new lamp is 2.3333333333333335 feet tall. Again, let's convert this to inches.\n\n2.3333333333333335 feet x 12 inches/foot = 27.99999999999998 inches tall\n\n3. Now that we have both lamps in the same unit of measurement (inches), we can subtract the height of the old lamp from the height of the new lamp to find out how much taller the new lamp is.\n\n27.99999999999998 inches - 12 inches = 15.99999999999998 inches\n\nSo, the new lamp is 15.99999999999998 inches taller than the old lamp!",

First, we need to convert both distances from miles to a common unit (like kilometers) so we can compare them directly:\n\n1 mile = 1.60934 kilometers (approximately)\n\nSo:\n\n19.83333333333332 miles = 19.833333333333332 x 1.60934 km/mile = 32.59999999999997 kilometers\n\n9.166666666666666 miles = 9.166666666666666 x 1.60934 km/mile = 14.55999999999999 kilometers\n\n2. Now that we have both distances in the same units, we can subtract the walking distance from the running distance to find out how much farther Wendy ran:\n\n32.59999999999997 kilometers - 14.55999999999999 kilometers = 18.04 kilometers\n\nSo, Wendy ran 18.04 kilometers farther than she walked.",

We can do this by multiplying 0.20 by the number:\n\n0.20 x Number =?\n3. Now, we know that 0.20 of a number decreased by 4 is equal to 6, so we can set up an equation:\n\n0.20x - 4 = 6\n4. Next, we can solve for the number by adding 4 to both sides of the equation:\n\n0.20x = 6 + 4\n0.20x = 10\n5. Finally, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.20 to find the original number:\n\nNumber = 10 / 0.20\nNumber = 50\n\nSo, the number is 50!",

        "prompt": "Freeport McMoran projects the world grain supply will be 1800000 metric tons and the supply will be only 0.75 of the world grain demand. What will the world grain demand be?",
        "reasoning": "Sure, let's work through this step by step!\n\nFreeport McMoran projects that the world grain supply will be 1800000 metric tons. This means that the total amount of grain produced globally is expected to be 1800000 metric tons.\n\nNext, we know that the supply will be only 0.75 of the world grain demand. This means that the world grain demand will be greater than the supply.\n\nLet's start by finding out what the world grain demand would be if the supply were 100% of the demand. To do this, we can use the following formula:\n\nWorld Grain Demand = Supply x (1 / 0.75)\n\nPlugging in the values we know, we get:\n\nWorld Grain Demand = 1800000 x (1 / 0.75)\n\nWorld Grain Demand = 2400000 metric tons\n\nSo, the world grain demand would be 2400000 metric tons if the supply were 100% of the demand.\n\nNow, we know that the supply will only be 0.75 of the demand, so we can calculate the world grain demand as follows:\n\nWorld Grain Demand = 2400000 x 0.75\n\nWorld Grain Demand = 1800000 metric tons\n\nTherefore, the world grain demand will be approximately 1800000 metric tons if the supply is only 0.75 of the demand.",

        "prompt": "A 12 ounce can of cranberry juice sells for 84 cents. What is the cost in cents per ounce.",
        "reasoning": "Sure! Let's calculate the cost per ounce of cranberry juice:\n\n1. First, we need to convert the price from dollars to cents:\n\n84 cents = 84 x 100 = 8400 cents\n\n2. Next, we need to divide the total number of cents by the number of ounces in the can:\n\n8400 cents / 12 ounces = 700 cents per ounce\n\nSo, the cost per ounce of cranberry juice is 700 cents or $7.00.",

        "prompt": "Manuel opened a savings account with an initial deposit of 177 dollars. If he wants to save 500 dollars during the next 19 weeks , how much must he save each week , in dollars?",
        "reasoning": "Sure, let's work through this step by step!\n\n1. First, we know that Manuel has an initial deposit of $177 in his savings account.\n2. He wants to save a total of $500 over the next 19 weeks.\n3. To find out how much he needs to save each week, we can divide the total amount he wants to save ($500) by the number of weeks he has to save it in (19):\n\n$500 \u00f7 19 = $26.32\n\nSo, Manuel needs to save $26.32 each week for the next 19 weeks to reach his goal of $500.",

The parts cost $225.\n\nWe can start by adding the cost of the parts to the total bill:\n\n$450 + $225 = $675\n\nNow, we can divide the total bill by the hourly rate to find out how many hours the job took:\n\n$675 \u00f7 $45 = 15 hours\n\nSo, the job took 15 hours.",
