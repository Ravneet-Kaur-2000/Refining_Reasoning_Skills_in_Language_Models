We know that Nancy can finish 8 problems in an hour, so if she has 17 math problems, it will take her:\n\n17 / 8 = 2 hours to finish all the math problems.\n\n3. Now, let's calculate how long it takes Nancy to finish the spelling problems.\n4. We know that Nancy can finish 8 problems in an hour, so if she has 15 spelling problems, it will take her:\n\n15 / 8 = 1.75 hours to finish all the spelling problems.\n\n5. Finally, we add up the time it takes Nancy to finish both sets of problems:\n\n2 hours (math) + 1.75 hours (spelling) = 3.75 hours total.\n\nSo, it will take Nancy approximately 3.75 hours to finish all 32 problems.",

So, to determine how many pages Will will need, we can divide the number of new cards by the number of cards per page:\n\n8 new cards \u00f7 3 cards per page = 2 pages\n\nThat means Will will need 2 pages to insert his 8 new cards.\n4. Now, Will also has 10 old cards to insert into the binder.\n5. Since each page can hold 3 cards, we can calculate how many pages Will will need for the old cards in the same way:\n\n10 old cards \u00f7 3 cards per page = 3 pages\n\nSo, Will will need a total of 2 + 3 = 5 pages to insert all of his cards.",
