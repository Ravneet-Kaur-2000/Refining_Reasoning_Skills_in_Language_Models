        "reasoning": "Sure! Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. There are 36 pickers working in the vineyard.\n2. Each drum requires 8 filled with grapes.\n3. In total, 240 drums need to be filled with grapes.\n\nNow, let's think about how long it will take to fill each drum:\n\n1. If there are 36 pickers and each drum needs 8 grapes, then each picker can fill 8 / 36 = 1/4 of a drum in one day.\n2. Since there are 240 drums to be filled, we can calculate how many days it will take to fill them as follows:\n\n240 drums x 1/4 drum per day = 60 days\n\nTherefore, it will take 60 days to fill all 240 drums of grapes if each picker can fill 1/4 of a drum per day.",

        "reasoning": "Sure! Let's start by using the information that the grasshopper jumped 19 inches. We know that the frog jumped 4 inches fewer than the grasshopper, so we can set up an equation:\n\nGrasshopper's jump = Frog's jump + Mouse's jump\n\nWe also know that the mouse jumped 44 inches less than the frog, so we can add that to our equation:\n\nGrasshopper's jump = Frog's jump + Mouse's jump - 44\n\nNow we need to find out how far the frog jumped. To do this, we can substitute the values we know into the equation:\n\nGrasshopper's jump = Frog's jump + Mouse's jump - 44\n\nGrasshopper's jump = 19 + Mouse's jump - 44\n\nMouse's jump = 19 + 44\n\nMouse's jump = 63\n\nSo the mouse jumped 63 inches. Now we can find out how far the frog jumped by subtracting the mouse's jump from the grasshopper's jump:\n\nFrog's jump = Grasshopper's jump - Mouse's jump\n\nFrog's jump = 19 - 63\n\nFrog's jump = -44\n\nSo the frog jumped 44 inches.",

        "reasoning": "Sure, let's break it down step by step!\n\n1. First, we know that Mary has already added 4 cups of flour, so we can subtract that from the total amount of flour needed (14 cups) to find out how much more flour she needs:\n\n14 cups - 4 cups = 10 cups\n\n2. Next, we know that the recipe calls for 9 cups of sugar, so we can subtract the amount of sugar Mary has already added (4 cups) from the total amount of sugar needed to find out how much more sugar she needs:\n\n9 cups - 4 cups = 5 cups\n\n3. Now, we know that Mary needs to add 10 cups of flour and 5 cups of sugar to complete the recipe.\n\nSo, to answer your question, Mary needs to add 10 cups of flour and 5 cups of sugar more than the amount of sugar she has already added (4 cups).",

        "reasoning": "Sure, let's work through this step by step!\n\n1. First, we know that 23 bird families flew away to Africa and 37 bird families flew away to Asia.\n2. So, if we subtract 23 from the total number of bird families, we get:\n\n85 - 23 = 62\n\nThis means there are 62 bird families left near the mountain.\n\n3. Next, we know that 37 bird families flew away to Asia.\n4. So, if we subtract 37 from the remaining number of bird families, we get:\n\n62 - 37 = 25\n\nThis means there are 25 bird families left near the mountain after both groups of birds migrated.\n\nSo, the answer is 25 bird families were left near the mountain after the migration.",
