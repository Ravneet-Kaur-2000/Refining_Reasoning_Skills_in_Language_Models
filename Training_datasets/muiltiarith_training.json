        "reasoning": "Sure, let's think step by step!\n\n1. The cafeteria ordered a total of 42 red apples and 7 green apples.\n2. If 9 students wanted fruit, we know that:\n\t* 9 students wanted red apples (since they are the most popular)\n\t* 9 students wanted green apples (since they are the second most popular)\n3. So, in total, the cafeteria will have to provide:\n\t* 9 x 42 = 368 red apples (since each student wants 42 red apples)\n\t* 9 x 7 = 63 green apples (since each student wants 7 green apples)\n4. Therefore, the cafeteria will end up with:\n\t* 368 + 63 = 431 apples (since 9 students wanted fruit)\n\nSo, the cafeteria will have 431 apples left over after all the students have chosen their fruit.",

But she only picked 36 tulips and 37 roses, so she must have picked extra flowers.\n\nTo find out how many extra flowers she picked, we need to subtract the number of flowers she picked from the total number of flowers she used:\n\n5210 - 36 - 37 = 5147\n\nSo, Lana picked 5147 extra flowers!",

We know that in total, they picked 45 carrots (29 + 16).\n\nNow, we are told that only 38 of the carrots were good. This means that some of the carrots they picked were not good. Let's call the number of good carrots \"x\".\n\nWe know that x + 29 = 38 (Carol picked 29 good carrots)\nx + 16 = 38 (Her mother picked 16 good carrots)\n\nSimplifying the equations, we get:\n\nx + 29 = 38\nx + 16 = 38\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second, we get:\n\n2x = 13\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\n\nx = 6\n\nSo, there were 6 bad carrots in the garden.",

        "prompt": "A waiter had 9 tables he was waiting on, with 2 women and 6 men at each table. How many customers total did the waiter have?",
        "reasoning": "Sure! Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Each table has 2 women and 6 men, so there are a total of 2 x 6 = 12 men at the tables.\n2. Since there are 9 tables, the total number of customers is 12 x 9 = 108 men.\n3. However, we haven't counted the two women yet.\n4. Each woman is sitting at one of the tables, so there are a total of 2 women.\n5. Therefore, the total number of customers the waiter has is 108 men + 2 women = 110 customers.",

        "prompt": "There were 4 friends playing a video game online when 5 more players joined the game. If each player had 3 lives, how many lives did they have total?",
        "reasoning": "Sure! Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. The four original players each had 3 lives, so together they had:\n\n4 x 3 = 12 lives\n\n2. Then, five more players joined the game, so now there are a total of:\n\n12 + 5 = 17 players\n\n3. Each of the new players also had 3 lives, so together they had:\n\n5 x 3 = 15 lives\n\n4. So, in total, all 17 players have:\n\n12 + 15 = 27 lives\n\nTherefore, the total number of lives among all 17 players is 27.",
