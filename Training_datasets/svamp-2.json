So, we can subtract the number of crayons he had at the beginning from the number of crayons he had at the end to find out how many crayons he used:\n\n601 - 336 = 265\n\nSo, Paul used 265 crayons during the school year.\n3. Now, we know that he didn't lose any erasers, so the number of erasers he had at the beginning is the same as the number of erasers he had at the end:\n\n406 - 406 = 0\n\nSo, Paul had no erasers left at the end of the school year.\n4. Finally, we can compare the number of erasers Paul had at the beginning (406) to the number of crayons he had at the beginning (601):\n\n406 < 601\n\nThis means that Paul had more crayons than erasers at the beginning of the school year.\n5. To find out how many more erasers than crayons Paul had, we can subtract the number of crayons from the number of erasers:\n\n601 - 406 = 195\n\nSo, Paul had 195 more erasers than crayons at the beginning of the school year.\n\nTherefore, at the end of the school year, Paul had 336 crayons and 406 - 336 = 195 more erasers than crayons.",

To do this, we need to calculate the total amount of money they made by selling the t-shirts.\n2.

Now, we can set up a ratio to represent the number of pages in each chapter:\n\nLet's say Chapter 1 has x pages.

        "reasoning": "Sure, let's think step by step! Let's use \"E\" to represent Ed and \"D\" to represent Doug.\n\n1. Ed had 2 more marbles than Doug, so we can say:\n\nE = D + 2\n\nThis means that Ed had 2 more marbles than Doug.\n\n2. Doug lost some of his marbles at the playground, so we can say:\n\nD = D - x\n\nwhere \"x\" is the number of marbles that Doug lost.\n\n3. Now, we know that Ed has 19 more marbles than Doug, so we can say:\n\nE = D + 2 + 19\n\nSubstituting equation 2 into equation 3, we get:\n\nE = (D + 2) + 19\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nE = D + 20\n\nSo, Ed has 20 more marbles than Doug.\n\n4. We know that Doug lost some marbles, so we can say:\n\nD < E\n\nIn other words, Doug has fewer marbles than Ed.\n\n5. Finally, we want to find out how many marbles Doug lost. We can do this by subtracting the number of marbles Doug has from the number of marbles Ed has:\n\nx = E - D\n\nSubstituting equations 1 and 4 into equation 5, we get:\n\nx = (D + 20) - D\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nx = 20\n\nSo, Doug lost 20 marbles at the playground.",

        "reasoning": "Sure, let's work through this step by step!\n\n1. Faye has 35 packs of pencils, and each pack has 4 pencils.\n2. To find out how many rows Faye can make, we need to divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils in each row (which is 2).\n3. So, we'll divide 35 (the total number of pencils) by 2:\n\n35 \u00f7 2 = 17\n\nThat means Faye can make 17 rows of pencils, since 17 is the quotient of 35 divided by 2. Each row will have 2 pencils, so there will be a total of 17 rows x 2 pencils per row = 34 pencils on the floor.\n\nI hope that helps!

        "reasoning": "Sure, let's work through this step by step!\n\nNell had 573 baseball cards in total.\n\nShe gave 195 cards to John, so now she has:\n\n573 - 195 = 378 cards left.\n\nShe also gave some more cards to Jeff, so now she has:\n\n378 - x cards left, where x is the number of cards given to Jeff.\n\nWe know that Nell has 210 cards left, so we can set up an equation:\n\n378 - x = 210\n\nTo solve for x, we can add 378 and 210:\n\n378 + 210 = 588\n\nNow we can subtract 378 from both sides:\n\n588 - 378 = 210\n\nThis gives us:\n\n210 = 210\n\nSo, Nell gave 0 cards to Jeff.
