We know that Nell gave some of her cards to Jeff, but we don't know how many yet.\n\nLet's start by looking at the total number of cards that Nell had:\n\n528\n\nNow, we know that she gave some of these cards to Jeff. Let's call the number of cards that she gave to Jeff \"x\".\n\nSo, if Nell gave x cards to Jeff, then she would have 528 - x cards left.\n\nWe also know that Jeff had 11 cards before Nell gave him any cards. So, if Nell gave x cards to Jeff, then Jeff would have 11 + x cards in total.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many cards Nell gave to Jeff so that we can figure out how many cards she has left. To do this, we can set up an equation based on the information we have:\n\n528 - x = 11 + x\n\nThis equation is true because Nell had 528 cards and gave some of them to Jeff, and Jeff had 11 cards before he received any cards from Nell.\n\nNow, we need to solve for x, which is the number of cards that Nell gave to Jeff. To do this, we can subtract 11 from both sides of the equation:\n\n528 - x = 11 + x\n\nSubtracting 11 from both sides gives us:\n\n417 = 2x\n\nDividing both sides by 2 gives us:\n\n208 = x\n\nSo, Nell gave 208 cards to Jeff.\n\nNow, we can find out how many cards Nell has left by subtracting the number of cards she gave to Jeff (208) from the total number of cards she had (528):\n\n528 - 208 = 320\n\nNell has 320 cards left after giving 208 cards to Jeff.",
