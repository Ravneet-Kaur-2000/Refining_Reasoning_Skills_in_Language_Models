What fraction of the students received either A \\'s or B \\'s ?\\n[A] Sure! Let\\'s break down the problem step by step:\\n1. The total number of students in Mr. Olsen\\'s mathematics class is 186.\\n2. Of these students, 0.7 (or 70%) received A\\'s.\\n3. This means that 0.7 x 186 = 129 students received A\\'s.\\n4. Of the remaining students, 0.2 (or 20%) received B\\'s.\\n5. This means that 0.2 x 186 = 37 students received B\\'s.\\n6. Therefore, a total of 129 + 37 = 166 students received either A\\'s or B\\'s.\\n7. To find the fraction of students who received either A\\'s or B\\'s, we can divide the total number of students by the number of students who received either A\\'s or B\\'s:\\n186 / 166 = 0.9\\nSo, the fraction of students who received either A\\'s or B\\'s is 0.9..--> 0.9 END\\n\\n[Q] There is 0.16666666666666666 cup of oil in Scarlett \\'s measuring cup .

How much farther did Jenny run than walk ?\\n[A] Sure! Let\\'s break down the problem step by step:\\n1. Jenny ran 0.6 miles.\\n2. Jenny walked 0.4 miles.\\nSo, we need to find out how much farther Jenny ran compared to walking. To do this, we can subtract the distance she walked from the distance she ran:\\n3. Jenny ran 0.6 - 0.4 = 0.2 miles farther than she walked.\\nTherefore, the answer is 0.2 miles..--> 0.2 END\\n\\n[Q] 0.5 the students in the band are in the trumpet section . 0.125 the students in the band are in the trombone section . What fraction of the students in the band are in either the trumpet section or the trombone section ?\\n[A] Sure! Let\\'s break down the problem step by step:\\n1. We know that 0.5 of the students in the band are in the trumpet section:\\n0.5 x 193 = 96.5 (students in the trumpet section)\\n2. We know that 0.125 of the students in the band are in the trombone section:\\n0.125 x 193 = 24.375 (students in the trombone section)\\n3. Now we need to find out how many students are in either the trumpet section or the trombone section:\\nTo add these two fractions, we can multiply the denominator (the number of students in the band) by the common factor of the numerators (the number of students in each section):\\n(193 x 24.375) / 193 = 0.625\\nSo, 0.625 of the students in the band are in either the trumpet section or the trombone section..--> 0.625 END\\n\\n[Q] Suzie found 2 worms in the yard and measured them with a ruler . 1 worm was 0.8 inch long .

We know that Vince\\'s bus ride is 0.625 miles long, and Zachary\\'s bus ride is 0.5 miles long.\\n2. To find out how much longer Vince\\'s bus ride is, we need to subtract Zachary\\'s bus ride from Vince\\'s bus ride.\\n3. So, we subtract 0.5 miles from 0.625 miles:\\n0.625 - 0.5 = 0.125\\n4. Therefore, Vince\\'s bus ride is 0.125 miles longer than Zachary\\'s bus ride..--> 0.125 END\\n\\n[Q] In 1 week , Mitch \\'s family drank 0.5 carton of regular milk and 0.1 carton of soy milk .

A carton of regular milk contains 4 liters.\\n3. So, we can calculate how much regular milk Mitch\\'s family drank as follows:\\n0.5 cartons x 4 liters/carton = 2 liters\\n4. Now, we know that Mitch\\'s family also drank 0.1 cartons of soy milk.\\n5. A carton of soy milk contains 2 liters.\\n6. So, we can calculate how much soy milk Mitch\\'s family drank as follows:\\n0.1 cartons x 2 liters/carton = 0.2 liters\\n7. Finally, we need to add up the amount of regular milk and soy milk that Mitch\\'s family drank:\\n2 liters (regular milk) + 0.2 liters (soy milk) = 2.2 liters\\nTherefore, Mitch\\'s family drank a total of 2.2 liters of milk in one week..--> 0.6 END\\n\\n[Q] Elizabeth went to the salon and had 0.375 inch of hair cut off .

Michelle started her pizza delivery route with 0.5 tank of gas in her car.\\n2. When she made it back to the pizzeria, 0.1666666666666666 tank of gas was left.\\nSo, we need to find out how much gas Michelle used during her delivery route. To do this, we can subtract the amount of gas left from the initial amount of gas:\\n0.5 - 0.1666666666666666 = 0.3333333333333333\\nTherefore, Michelle used 0.3333333333333333 gallons of gas during her delivery route..--> 0.3333333333333333 END\\n\\n[Q] While taking inventory at her pastry shop , Kelly realizes that she had 0.4 box of baking powder yesterday , but the supply is now down to 0.3 box .

We also know that 0.5 of the nails are size 4d, which means there are 50% of the nails that are size 4d.\\n3. To find out what fraction of the nails are either size 2d or 4d, we need to add the fraction of nails that are size 2d and the fraction of nails that are size 4d.\\n4. Since 25% + 50% = 75%, we can see that 75% of the nails are either size 2d or 4d.\\nSo, the answer is 0.75 (or 75%)..--> 0.75 END\\n\\n[Q] While making desserts for a bake sale , Victor used 0.625 scoop of brown sugar as well as 0.25 scoop of white sugar .

Let\\'s break down the problem step by step:\\n1. Jake had 1 cat, and he needed to serve 0.5 can of cat food each day.\\n2. Now, Jake has adopted a second cat, so he needs to serve a total of 0.9 can of cat food each day (0.5 + 0.4).\\n3. To find out how much extra food is needed to feed the second cat, we need to subtract the amount of food Jake was serving before (0.5) from the total amount he needs to serve now (0.9):\\n0.9 - 0.5 = 0.4\\nSo, Jake needs 0.4 can of extra food per day to feed his second cat..--> 0.4 END\\n\\n[Q] In Yardley it snowed 0.125 inch in the morning and 0.5 inch in the afternoon .

Let\\'s break down the problem step by step:\\n1. We know that the piece of iron weighed 11.166666666666666 pounds.\\n2. We know that the piece of aluminum weighed 0.8333333333333334 pounds.\\n3. We want to find out how much more the piece of iron weighs than the piece of aluminum.\\nTo do this, we can subtract the weight of the piece of aluminum from the weight of the piece of iron:\\n11.166666666666666 - 0.8333333333333334 = 10.333333333333334\\nSo, the piece of iron weighs 10.333333333333334 pounds more than the piece of aluminum..--> 10.333333333333334 END\\n\\n[Q] As part of a lesson on earthquakes , a science class is researching the movement of a nearby fault line . The fault line moved 1.25 inches during the past year and 5.25 inches the year before . How far did the fault line move in all ?\\n[A] Sure! Let\\'s break down the problem step by step:\\n1. First, we need to find out how much the fault line moved in each year.\\nThe question tells us that the fault line moved 1.25 inches during the past year, so we can write this down as:\\n1.25 inches (past year)\\n2. Now, we need to find out how much the fault line moved the year before.\\nThe question tells us that the fault line moved 5.25 inches the year before, so we can write this down as:\\n5.25 inches (year before)\\n3. Now that we have both amounts, we can add them together to find out how far the fault line moved in all:\\n1.25 inches (past year) + 5.25 inches (year before) = 6.5 inches (total movement)\\nSo, the fault line moved a total of 6.5 inches..--> 6.5 END\\n\\n[Q] Hoping to be named Salesperson of the Month , Rosa called the names from 10.2 pages of the phone book last week .
