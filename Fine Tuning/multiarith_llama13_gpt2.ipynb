The cafeteria ordered a total of 42 red apples and 7 green apples.\\n2. If 9 students wanted fruit, we know that:\\n\\t* 9 students wanted red apples (since they are the most popular)\\n\\t* 9 students wanted green apples (since they are the second most popular)\\n3. So, in total, the cafeteria will have to provide:\\n\\t* 9 x 42 = 368 red apples (since each student wants 42 red apples)\\n\\t* 9 x 7 = 63 green apples (since each student wants 7 green apples)\\n4. Therefore, the cafeteria will end up with:\\n\\t* 368 + 63 = 431 apples (since 9 students wanted fruit)\\nSo, the cafeteria will have 431 apples left over after all the students have chosen their fruit.--\u003e 40 END\\n\\n[Q] Lana picked 36 tulips and 37 roses to make flower bouquets.

She used 70 of the flowers to make bouquets.\\nSo, we can start by finding out how many tulips and roses she used:\\nTulips: 36 x 70 = 2520\\nRoses: 37 x 70 = 2690\\nTotal: 2520 + 2690 = 5210\\nNow, we know that Lana used 5210 flowers to make her bouquets. But she only picked 36 tulips and 37 roses, so she must have picked extra flowers.\\nTo find out how many extra flowers she picked, we need to subtract the number of flowers she picked from the total number of flowers she used:\\n5210 - 36 - 37 = 5147\\nSo, Lana picked 5147 extra flowers!--\u003e 3 END\\n\\n[Q] Carol and her mom were picking carrots from their garden. Carol picked 29 and her mother picked 16. If only 38 of the carrots were good, how many bad carrots did they have?\\n[A] Sure, let\\'s think step by step!\\nLet\\'s start with the information that Carol picked 29 carrots and her mother picked 16 carrots. We know that in total, they picked 45 carrots (29 + 16).\\nNow, we are told that only 38 of the carrots were good. This means that some of the carrots they picked were not good. Let\\'s call the number of good carrots \"x\".\\nWe know that x + 29 = 38 (Carol picked 29 good carrots)\\nx + 16 = 38 (Her mother picked 16 good carrots)\\nSimplifying the equations, we get:\\nx + 29 = 38\\nx + 16 = 38\\nSubtracting the first equation from the second, we get:\\n2x = 13\\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\\nx = 6\\nSo, there were 6 bad carrots in the garden.--\u003e 7 END\\n\\n[Q] Roger had 16 dollars.
