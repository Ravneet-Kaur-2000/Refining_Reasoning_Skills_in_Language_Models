Number of students who suggested adding tomatoes: 79\\nNow, we can find out how many more students suggested mashed potatoes than those who suggested tomatoes by subtracting the number of students who suggested tomatoes from the number of students who suggested mashed potatoes:\\n144 - 79 = 65\\nSo, 65 more students suggested mashed potatoes than those who suggested tomatoes.--> 65.0 END\\n\\n[Q] Jesse\\'s rooms are 19 feet long and 18 feet wide. If she has 20 rooms in all How much carpet does she need to cover the floors of all rooms?\\n[A] Sure, let\\'s work through this step by step!\\n1. First, we need to find the total area of each room. To do this, we multiply the length (19 feet) by the width (18 feet):\\n19 x 18 = 344 square feet per room\\nSo, each room has an area of 344 square feet.\\n2. Next, we need to find the total area of all 20 rooms. To do this, we multiply the area of one room (344 square feet) by the number of rooms (20):\\n344 x 20 = 6,880 square feet\\nSo, the total area of all 20 rooms is 6,880 square feet.\\n3. Now, we need to calculate how much carpet Jesse needs to cover the floors of all rooms. To do this, we divide the total area of all rooms (6,880 square feet) by the area of one room (344 square feet):\\n6,880 / 344 = 20.17\\nSo, Jesse needs approximately 20.17 square meters of carpet to cover the floors of all her rooms.\\nI hope that helps!

How much money did they make from selling the t-shirts?\\n[A] Sure, let\\'s work through this step by step!\\n1. First, we need to find out how much money the Razorback t-shirt shop made from selling the t-shirts during the Arkansas and Texas Tech game. To do this, we need to calculate the total amount of money they made by selling the t-shirts.\\n2. The t-shirts were sold at a discount of $8 per t-shirt, so we need to subtract the discount from the original price of the t-shirts. In this case, the original price of each t-shirt was $51.\\n3. So, if we subtract $8 from $51, we get:\\n$51 - $8 = $43\\nThis means that the Razorback t-shirt shop made $43 per t-shirt.\\n4. Since they sold 130 t-shirts, we can multiply $43 by 130 to find out how much money they made in total:\\n$43 x 130 = $5,690\\nSo, the Razorback t-shirt shop made $5,690 from selling t-shirts during the Arkansas and Texas Tech game.--> 5590.0 END\\n\\n[Q] 5 storks and 3 birds were sitting on the fence. 4 more birds came to join them.

How much money did they make from selling the t-shirts?\\n[A] Sure, let\\'s work through this step by step!\\n1. First, we need to find out how much money the Razorback t-shirt shop made from selling the t-shirts during the Arkansas and Texas Tech game. To do this, we need to calculate the total amount of money earned from selling the t-shirts.\\n2. The original price of each t-shirt was $201, so if they sold 14 t-shirts at this price, they would have earned:\\n14 x $201 = $2,814\\n3. However, during the Arkansas and Texas Tech game, the prices were increased by $217 per t-shirt, so the new price of each t-shirt was:\\n$201 + $217 = $418\\n4. If they sold 14 t-shirts at this new price, they would have earned:\\n14 x $418 = $5,872\\n5.

After deleting some apps and files he had 24 files and 2 apps left. How many more files than apps does he have left on the phone?\\n[A] Sure, let\\'s work through this step by step!\\nSo, Dave started with:\\n* 11 apps\\n* 3 files\\nTotal: 11 + 3 = 14 items on his phone.\\nAfter deleting some apps and files, Dave was left with:\\n* 2 apps (let\\'s say he deleted 9 apps)\\n* 24 files (he kept all 3 files and added 21 more)\\nTotal: 2 + 24 = 26 items on his phone.\\nNow, we can see that Dave has more files than apps left on his phone:\\n24 files - 2 apps = 22 more files than apps\\nSo, Dave has 22 more files than apps left on his phone.--> 22.0 END\\n\\n[Q] Rebecca wants to split a collection of eggs into groups of 11. If each group has 2 eggs How many eggs does Rebecca have?\\n[A] Sure, let\\'s think step by step!\\n1. Rebecca has a total of 11 eggs.\\nCan you tell me how many groups of 2 eggs she can make with these 11 eggs?--> 22.0 END\\n\\n[Q] Jack received 10 emails in the morning, 7 emails in the afternoon and 17 emails in the evening. How many more emails did Jack receive in the morning than in the afternoon?\\n[A] Sure! Let\\'s break it down step by step:\\n1. Jack received 10 emails in the morning.\\n2. He received 7 emails in the afternoon.\\n3. So, the difference between the number of emails Jack received in the morning and the number of emails he received in the afternoon is:\\n10 - 7 = 3\\nSo, Jack received 3 more emails in the morning than in the afternoon.--> 3.0 END\\n\\n[Q] Adam could fit 11 action figures on each shelf in his room. His room has 4 shelves and 40 cabinets. How many total action figures could his shelves hold?\\n[A] Sure! Let\\'s break it down step by step:\\n1. Adam\\'s room has 4 shelves.\\n2. Each shelf can hold 11 action figures.\\n3. So, the total number of action figures that each shelf can hold is 11 x 4 = 44 action figures.\\n4. Since Adam\\'s room has 4 shelves, the total number of action figures that all the shelves can hold is 44 x 4 = 176 action figures.\\nSo, Adam\\'s shelves could hold a total of 176 action figures.--> 44.0 END\\n\\n[Q] Lucy went to the grocery store. She bought 10 packs of cookie and 4 packs of cake. How many more packs of cookie did she buy over cake?\\n[A] Sure, let\\'s analyze this step by step:\\n1. Lucy bought 10 packs of cookies.\\n2. She also bought 4 packs of cake.\\nNow, let\\'s compare the number of packs of cookies and cake that Lucy bought:\\n10 (cookies) - 4 (cake) = 6\\nSo, Lucy bought 6 more packs of cookies than cake.-->
